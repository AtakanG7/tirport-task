# Welcome to Our NestJS and React Project!

This repository contains the code for our project, which consists of a NestJS backend server and a React frontend server. You can find detailed information and instructions inside each respective folder.

## Backend (NestJS)

The backend server is built using NestJS, a progressive Node.js framework. It provides a robust and scalable architecture for building server-side applications.
